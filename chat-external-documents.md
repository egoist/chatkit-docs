# Chat over External Documents

## Chat context

ChatKit allows you to add URLs as chat context, it's useful for summarizing external documents or ask questions over them.

Documents added in chat context will be retrieved using semantic search, meaning only the relevant parts of the document will be used in the conversation.

## Message attachments

If you want to include the entire document in the conversation, you can upload it as a message attachment:
