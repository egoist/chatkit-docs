# Google Gemini

ChatKit currently supports Gemini Pro and Gemini Pro Vision.

To use Gemini you need an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/u/2/app/apikey).

It's currently free and a Pay-as-you-go plan will be available soon, check out Google AI's [pricing page](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) for more.

When you have your API key, you can set it in [Settings -> Models](https://chatkit.app/#settings/models).
