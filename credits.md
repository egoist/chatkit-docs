## How to use credits

First, remove the OpenAI API key on ChatKit if you have set it before because this setting takes precedence over credits:

Alternately, you can force specific chats to use credits even if you have OpenAI API key in your settings:

The chat interface has an indicator to show whether you're using credits or API key:

## Pricing

$5 in credits are priced at exactly $5 USD. Our pricing aligns with OpenAI's, with no addtional fees added, so please refer to [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing) for details on their API costs.

## Where are credits used?

Any feature that is provided by OpenAI API can be used with credits.
