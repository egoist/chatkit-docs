# Credits

ChatKit [Premium](https://chatkit.app/#pricing) has the option to buy credits and use them instead of providing an OpenAI API Key.

## Pricing

$5 credits cost exactly $5 USD, different API will cost a different amount of credits, Our pricing is based on OpenAI pricing plus 30% fee, the final price is as follows:

| API            | Cost                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| GPT-3.5        | $0.0026 per 1000 tokens |
| Speech-to-Text | $0.0078 per minute      |

## Limitation

Currently credits can only be used with the GPT-3.5 model, since we don't have access to GPT-4 API for now.
