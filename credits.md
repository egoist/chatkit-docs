## How to use credits

First, remove the OpenAI API key on ChatKit if you have set it before:

This setting takes precedence over credits.

Alternately, you can force specific chats to use credits even if you have OpenAI API key in your settings:

The chat interface has an indicator to show whether you're using credits or API key:
