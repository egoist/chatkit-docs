# Refund Policy

We offer refunds for ChatKit License within 14 days of purchase. Please note that ChatKit credits are NOT refundable.

We generally accept refund requests for any reason, but there are a few exceptions. Refunds will not be provided if:

- You mistakenly believed that the ChatKit License would grant you free access to OpenAI services. Please note that an API key or ChatKit credits are required. This information is available on our pricing page.
- Your account has been found to engage in malicious activity.

If you would like to request a refund, please contact us at kevin@chatkit.app. We will respond to your request within 24 hours.
