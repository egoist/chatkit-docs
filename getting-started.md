# Getting Started

## Using API key or Credits

There're two ways to use ChatKit:

1. Using Your own OpenAI API key
2. Using ChatKit Credits (requires ChatKit Premium)

## Using OpenAI API key

::: warning
Using OpenAI API key does NOT require a ChatGPT Plus subscription, ChatGPT Plus subscription does NOT affect the OpenAI API key usage.

Using OpenAI API key is NOT free, you will follow OpenAI's pricing model. OpenAI is pay as you go, so you only pay for the tokens you use, which is much cheaper than ChatGPT Plus. Here's the detail price for all the models: https://openai.com/pricing
:::

1. Go to [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) and create an account
2. Upgrade to a paid plan on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview), because free accounts have usage limits and also rate limits. OpenAI is pay as you go, so you only pay for what you use.
3. Go to [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and create a new API key.
4. Go to ChatKit and open App Settings (top-right corner) to paste the OpenAI API key (see the video below)
