# Launcher

ChatKit Launcher is a feature exclusively in the desktop version of ChatKit. It allows you to quickly run your saved prompts or custom prompts from anywhere on your computer.

The launcher is based on Prompt Templates, so be sure to learn about [Prompt Templates](prompt-templates.md) first.

## How to use

In the desktop version of Prompt Templates, you can bind a shortcut to them:

For example you can bind `CommandOrControl+Shift+/,` and when the shortcut is triggered, it will open a panel for quick access to prompts:

## Limitations

- Currently it doesn't support plugins, i.e. you can't use it to run a prompt that requires a plugin, like generating images. But it will be supported in the future.
